# Terraform-Project

The Project is a custom module to deploy an application in us-east-1 and eu-west-2 regions. \
Each country will have its own instance of software deployed on an AWS instance using the same architecture.

1. It consists of a single ec2instance using the custom AMI, that holds the 
application server.
2. A DynamoDB NoSQL database that will be used to store the data.
3. S3 bucket which will be used to save documents.
4. Default VPC and subnets are used.  <br />
